A-Moment-of-Motivation
======================
This is A Moment of Motivation. It provides a window to another world, along 
with some encouragement to keep you on your way. Sometimes, we all just need a break.

I created a JavaScript file that handles all of the JSON requests. I used Flickr's API to get a random background image and 8tracks API to get a random song. The quotes are selected from a JavaScript with a list of quotes. I attempted to use an API that allows for JSON requests for quotes. However, while I could find good quote API's, I could not find one that allowed me to simply request the quote without the author's name. This is why I decided to manually get quotes from my own file.
