A-Moment-of-Motivation
======================
This is A Moment of Motivation. It provides a window to another world, along 
with some encouragement to keep you on your way. Sometimes, we all just need a break.

The request.js file makes JSON requests to get a random wallpaper from Flickr and a song from 8tracks.
The quotes are selected from the quotes.js by using a random number generator. I attempted to use an API that allows for JSON requests for quotes. However, while I could find good quote API's, I could not find one that allowed me to simply request the quote without the author's name.
